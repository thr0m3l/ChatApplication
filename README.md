# ChatApplication
CSE 108 Networking Offline

This is a simple console based chat application that uses multithreaded server. I used Java 8 and Java Socket to build this.
It was done as an assignment in Level-1/Term-2 Object Oriented Programming Sessional course. 

A few disclaimer:
  1. As I was new to OOP back then and had to fullfill a few of the assignment specifications, many of my codes looks pretty dumb. Sorry for that!
  2. Simple as it looks, it took me 3 days to build this! :'(
  3. You may use this as a help to your Java Networking assignment but I recommend please don't copy this.
